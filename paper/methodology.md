# Abstract

Object detection in autonomous driving degrades sharply under foggy
conditions, where the atmospheric scattering model couples scene radiance,
transmission, and depth in a way that confounds conventional detectors.
Existing approaches either dehaze the image as a preprocessing step and feed
the restored output to a detector, or train a detector directly on foggy
images without exploiting restoration cues. Both paradigms are suboptimal:
the former propagates restoration errors into detection, while the latter
ignores the physically grounded information that dehazing provides. We
propose the **Weather-Resilient Detection Unified Network (WRDNet)**, a
multi-branch architecture that jointly performs restoration, detection, and
depth estimation while adaptively fusing features across the restoration and
detection streams. At the core of WRDNet is a **Feature Selection Gate (FSG)**
that learns a per-pixel, multi-scale weighting between dehazed and original
features, allowing the network to exploit restoration cues where they are
beneficial without committing to a single restored image. We further introduce
a **Depth-Guided FSG (DG-FSG)** that uses estimated monocular depth to
actively modulate the fusion, exploiting the physical coupling between fog
severity and scene depth. To address the synthetic-to-real domain gap, we
propose a multi-level frequency-aware domain-adaptation strategy combining
Fourier Domain Adaptation, DCT-based feature alignment, and a novel
FSG-consistency loss. We also exploit the multi-density structure of the Foggy
Cityscapes dataset to train across three scattering coefficients, tripling the
effective data and enforcing fog-severity invariance. Extensive experiments on
Foggy Cityscapes, ACDC, Foggy Driving, and Foggy Zurich demonstrate that
WRDNet consistently outperforms sequential dehaze-then-detect baselines and
prior joint approaches, while the learned gating maps provide physically
interpretable evidence that the model adapts its fusion policy to scene depth
and fog density.

# I. Introduction

## Research Gaps and Contributions

A systematic review of the fog-removal and adverse-weather detection
literature reveals several persistent limitations that motivate our work. We
synthesize these gaps and state the corresponding contributions of WRDNet.

### Identified Research Gaps

**G1 — The sequential dehaze-then-detect paradigm is suboptimal.**
Classical prior-based methods, beginning with the Dark Channel Prior (DCP)
[1], and their lightweight variants [2, 3, 4], treat restoration as a
standalone preprocessing step that produces a single dehazed image for a
downstream detector. This decoupling is fundamentally limited: the
atmospheric scattering model couples restoration and detection through the
transmission map, yet the two stages are optimized independently. As a
consequence, restoration errors propagate directly into detection.
Over-aggressive dehazing can hallucinate artifacts in near-field regions
(where fog is thin and the prior is unreliable), while conservative
restoration leaves distant objects obscured. The detector is forced to
operate on a single, fixed restored representation that cannot adapt to the
spatially varying reliability of the dehazing output. Recent reviews of
defogging for object detection [5, 6] confirm that this sequential paradigm
consistently underperforms joint approaches, motivating feature-level
integration.

**G2 — Restoration quality is not aligned with detection objectives.**
Dehazing methods are predominantly optimized for image-quality metrics such
as PSNR, SSIM, BRISQUE, and NIQE [2, 7, 8, 9]. These perceptual metrics do
not correlate with downstream detection performance: an image that scores
well on structural similarity may still be suboptimal for object
localization, particularly for small and distant objects that are most
vulnerable under fog. The Cycle-Defog2Refog framework [7] and the Gamma-CNN
enhancement method [8] both optimize reconstruction fidelity without any
task-aware signal, while the histogram-equalization family [9, 10] applies
content-agnostic contrast enhancement. This metric misalignment means that
even a "perfectly" dehazed image, by perceptual standards, does not
guarantee improved detection, and can in fact degrade it by amplifying
noise.

**G3 — Single-density training limits fog-severity robustness.**
Foggy-driving benchmarks are typically constructed at a single scattering
coefficient $\beta$ [2, 4, 11], causing detectors to memorize a specific
atmospheric appearance. In real driving, visibility varies continuously
with fog density, and a detector trained at one operating point fails to
generalize across the continuum. The multi-density nature of the Foggy
Cityscapes dataset [12] — which renders each scene at
$\beta \in \{0.005, 0.01, 0.02\}$ — is rarely exploited, leaving a
significant source of physically grounded training signal unused.

**G4 — The synthetic-to-real domain gap is unaddressed.**
Methods trained exclusively on synthetic fog [2, 3, 7] degrade on real
foggy images due to the distribution shift between simulated and physical
fog. Prior work either ignores this gap entirely or relies on large,
manually curated real datasets that are expensive to obtain. The
Cycle-Defog2Refog framework [7] explicitly acknowledges that its
physics-based refogging model fails under dense fog, and that its real
dataset (MRFID) is too small (200 scenes) for robust generalization.
Domain-adaptation methods for adverse weather [13, 14] address this gap but
focus on a single alignment level, leaving multi-level alignment
unexplored.

**G5 — Depth information is underutilized.**
The atmospheric scattering model explicitly couples fog severity to scene
depth ($t(\mathbf{x}) = e^{-\beta d(\mathbf{x})}$), yet existing joint
dehazing-detection methods either ignore depth entirely or output it as a
parallel prediction that never feeds back into the detection decision.
Methods such as DEHRFormer and DCL estimate depth as a byproduct of
dehazing but do not use it to modulate the fusion of restored and original
features. This is a missed opportunity: depth is a physically meaningful
prior that indicates *where* dehazing is most beneficial.

**G6 — Numerical instability in joint training.**
Jointly optimizing restoration and detection is notoriously unstable.
Unbounded feature magnitudes from the restoration branch can destabilize
the detection head's box regression, and mixed-precision training can
introduce overflow-induced NaNs. Prior work does not systematically address
these practical obstacles, which are critical for reproducible, stable
training of multi-task adverse-weather detectors.

### Contributions of WRDNet

**C1 — Joint, feature-level fusion via the Feature Selection Gate (FSG).**
Rather than committing to a single restored image, WRDNet keeps the detection
backbone on the *original* foggy image and injects dehazed cues *at the
feature level* through a learned, per-pixel gating mechanism. This directly
addresses **G1** and **G2**: the network learns *where* dehazing is beneficial
rather than trusting it uniformly, and the gate is trained end-to-end with the
detection objective rather than a perceptual metric.

**C2 — Multi-density fog training.** We exploit the fact that Foggy Cityscapes
[12] provides each scene at three scattering coefficients
$\beta \in \{0.005, 0.01, 0.02\}$, tripling the effective training data and
enforcing fog-severity invariance. This addresses **G3** by compelling the
network to learn representations robust across the atmospheric continuum.

**C3 — Multi-level frequency-aware domain adaptation.** We bridge the
synthetic-to-real gap (**G4**) through three complementary mechanisms: Fourier
Domain Adaptation (FDA) at the input level, DCT-based feature alignment at the
representation level, and a novel FSG-consistency loss at the output level.
This multi-level strategy aligns the two domains without requiring real
annotations.

**C4 — Depth-guided feature fusion (DG-FSG).** We introduce the first
mechanism in which estimated monocular depth *actively modulates* how restored
and original features are combined, exploiting the physical coupling between
fog and depth (**G5**). The gate learns to trust dehazed features more for
distant objects and original features more for nearby objects, producing a
physically interpretable fusion policy.

**C5 — A numerically stable joint-training recipe.** We address **G6** through
a combination of bfloat16 mixed precision (which avoids the overflow-induced
NaNs of float16), a magnitude clamp on the fused features, and a two-phase
training schedule that first establishes a robust detection baseline before
enabling the fusion and domain-adaptation modules.

# II. Related Work

The design of WRDNet is grounded in a rich body of prior work on image
dehazing, adverse-weather detection, and domain adaptation. We organize this
review around the principal research directions that motivate our approach,
and we position WRDNet relative to each.

**Classical dehazing.** Early methods rely on hand-crafted priors, most
notably the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) [1] and its lightweight variants [2, 3,
4]. These methods estimate the transmission map and atmospheric light from
statistical priors and recover the scene radiance via the atmospheric
scattering model. While computationally efficient, they are prone to failure
under dense fog and overexposed regions, and they do not adapt to the
downstream detection task.

**Learning-based dehazing.** Deep learning methods replace hand-crafted priors
with learned mappings. Cycle-consistent adversarial networks [7] enable
unpaired dehazing, while transformer-based methods such as DehazeFormer [15]
and TCL-Net [17] achieve state-of-the-art restoration quality. However, these
methods are optimized for perceptual image-quality metrics rather than
downstream detection performance.

**Adverse-weather detection.** Recent work enhances detectors for foggy
conditions through attention and multi-scale fusion, including YOLOv8s-WAMNet
[16] and CAST-YOLO [14]. These methods improve robustness but do not jointly
optimize restoration and detection, and they do not exploit depth information.

**Domain adaptation.** To bridge the synthetic-to-real gap, Fourier Domain
Adaptation (FDA) [21] aligns input-level spectral statistics, while
feature-level alignment methods such as AdaDCP align representations in the
frequency domain. These methods address the domain gap but focus on a single
alignment level.

**Depth estimation.** Monocular depth estimation methods such as DPT and MiDaS
provide dense depth maps from a single image. Prior joint dehazing-detection
methods such as DEHRFormer and DCL estimate depth as a byproduct of dehazing
but do not use it to modulate feature fusion.

# III. Methodology

## Problem Formulation

We address the task of object detection under foggy driving conditions. Let
$\mathcal{I} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W \times 3}$ denote a foggy RGB image
captured by an onboard camera, and let $\mathcal{Y} = \{(\mathbf{b}_i, c_i)\}$
denote the set of ground-truth detections, where $\mathbf{b}_i \in
\mathbb{R}^4$ is the bounding box and $c_i \in \{0, \dots, C-1\}$ is the class
label over $C$ semantic categories. Our objective is to learn a mapping
$f_\theta: \mathcal{I} \mapsto \mathcal{Y}$ that remains accurate across a
continuum of atmospheric conditions.

Fog degrades the observed radiance through the atmospheric scattering model
[22]:

$$
\mathbf{I}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x}) \, t(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{A} \,
\big(1 - t(\mathbf{x})\big),
$$

where $\mathbf{J}(\mathbf{x})$ is the clean scene radiance, $\mathbf{A}$ is the
global atmospheric light, and $t(\mathbf{x}) \in [0,1]$ is the transmission
map. Under a homogeneous atmosphere, the transmission decays exponentially
with scene depth $d(\mathbf{x})$:

$$
t(\mathbf{x}) = e^{-\beta \, d(\mathbf{x})},
$$

with $\beta > 0$ the scattering coefficient (fog density). This formulation
reveals a central tension for detection: aggressive dehazing can recover
texture in the far field but may amplify noise and hallucinate artifacts near
the camera, whereas conservative restoration preserves fidelity but leaves
distant objects obscured. A detector that commits to a single restored
representation therefore operates at a fixed point on this accuracy–fidelity
trade-off.

## Weather Resilience of WRDNet

We define *weather resilience* as the capacity of a detector to sustain
accurate performance across a continuum of atmospheric conditions, as opposed
to a single operating point. WRDNet realizes this property through four
complementary mechanisms that jointly address the spatial, severity,
depth-conditional, and domain dimensions of weather variability.

- **Spatial resilience through adaptive feature fusion.** Fog exhibits
  pronounced spatial non-uniformity: near-field regions undergo only mild
  degradation, whereas distant regions are heavily obscured. A detector that
  commits to a single restored representation cannot accommodate this spatial
  variation. The Feature Selection Gate (FSG) learns a per-pixel weighting
  $\boldsymbol{\alpha}(\mathbf{x})$ that interpolates between dehazed and
  original features at every location. In regions where dehazing is reliable
  (distant, fog-obscured areas), the gate favors restored features; where
  dehazing risks introducing artifacts (near-field, thin fog), it retains the
  original features. This spatial adaptivity constitutes the first pillar of
  weather resilience.

- **Severity resilience through multi-density training.** The scattering
  coefficient $\beta$ varies continuously in real driving, spanning light mist
  to dense fog. A detector trained at a single $\beta$ memorizes a specific
  atmospheric appearance and generalizes poorly. WRDNet exploits the
  multi-density structure of Foggy Cityscapes, which renders each scene at
  $\beta \in \{0.005, 0.01, 0.02\}$. This enforces fog-severity invariance,
  compelling the network to learn representations that remain discriminative
  across the entire visibility continuum rather than at a single operating
  point. This constitutes the second pillar of weather resilience.

- **Depth-conditional resilience through DG-FSG.** The atmospheric scattering
  model couples fog severity to scene depth via $t(\mathbf{x}) =
  e^{-\beta d(\mathbf{x})}$. WRDNet exploits this physical prior by
  conditioning its fusion policy on estimated monocular depth. The
  Depth-Guided FSG (DG-FSG) learns to favor dehazed features for distant
  objects and original features for nearby objects, yielding a fusion policy
  that is physically consistent with the scattering model. This
  depth-conditional behavior constitutes the third pillar of weather
  resilience.

- **Domain resilience through multi-level domain adaptation.** Synthetic fog
  differs from real fog in its spectral and textural statistics. WRDNet
  bridges this synthetic-to-real gap through a multi-level domain-adaptation
  strategy that aligns the two domains at the input level (FDA), the feature
  level (DCT alignment), and the output level (FSG consistency). This ensures
  that the learned representations transfer to real-world fog, constituting
  the fourth pillar of weather resilience.

Collectively, these four mechanisms enable WRDNet to preserve detection
accuracy across varying fog density, spatial extent, and domain shift, which
is the defining property of a weather-resilient detector.

## Architectural Overview

We propose the **Weather-Resilient Detection Unified Network (WRDNet)**, a
multi-branch architecture that jointly performs restoration, detection, and
depth estimation while adaptively fusing features across the restoration and
detection streams. The complete model is illustrated in Fig. 1 and comprises
four principal components:

1. **Restoration branch** — a lightweight DehazeFormer-T [15]
   transformer that estimates the clean image $\hat{\mathbf{J}}$ and exposes
   multi-scale encoder features.
2. **Detection branch** — a YOLOv11s [25] detector whose
   backbone operates on the *original* foggy image to preserve spatial
   resolution and small-object cues.
3. **Feature Selection Gate (FSG)** — a learned, per-pixel gating mechanism
   that fuses restoration and detection features at three scales.
4. **Depth decoder** — a lightweight progressive upsampling head that
   estimates monocular depth to guide the fusion (DG-FSG variant).

A key design decision is that the detection backbone consumes the **original
foggy image** rather than the dehazed output. This preserves the native
resolution and high-frequency content required for detecting small and distant
objects, which are precisely the most vulnerable under fog. The restored
representation is injected *at the feature level* through the FSG, allowing the
network to selectively exploit dehazed cues where they are beneficial without
committing to a single restored image.

## Feature Selection Gate (FSG)

The central contribution of WRDNet is the Feature Selection Gate, which learns
a spatially varying interpolation between restoration and detection features.
Let $\mathbf{F}^r \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times H_s \times W_s}$ and $\mathbf{F}^o
\in \mathbb{R}^{C \times H_s \times W_s}$ denote the restoration and original
feature maps at scale $s$, respectively. The FSG produces a gating map
$\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in [0,1]^{1 \times H_s \times W_s}$ via a small
convolutional gating network $g_\phi$:

$$
\boldsymbol{\alpha} = \sigma\Big( g_\phi\big( [\mathbf{F}^r; \, \mathbf{F}^o]
\big) \Big),
$$

where $[\cdot;\cdot]$ denotes channel-wise concatenation and $\sigma$ is the
sigmoid activation. The fused feature is then computed as a convex combination:

$$
\mathbf{F}^f = \boldsymbol{\alpha} \odot \mathbf{F}^r + (1 -
\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \odot \mathbf{F}^o,
$$

where $\odot$ is the Hadamard product. Because $\boldsymbol{\alpha} \in
[0,1]$, the fused feature lies on the line segment between the two branches,
guaranteeing that the gate can never amplify or invert the input statistics.
Intuitively, $\alpha \to 1$ selects the dehazed representation (beneficial for
distant, fog-obscured regions), while $\alpha \to 0$ retains the original
features (beneficial for near-field regions where dehazing may introduce
artifacts).

To enrich the gating context, we integrate a **Cross-Dimensional Multi-Scale
Attention (CDMSA)** module that computes channel, spatial, and cross-scale
attention over the concatenated features. The cross-scale term propagates
information from coarser scales to refine the gating decision at finer scales.

**Stability analysis.** A critical practical concern is the numerical
stability of the fused features when propagated through the detection head.
The YOLO detection head employs Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) [23], which
predicts a discrete distribution over box-edge offsets. If the
fused features exhibit unbounded magnitude, the DFL logits can saturate,
causing the predicted box edges to collapse to a degenerate configuration. To
prevent this, we apply a magnitude clamp after normalization:

$$
\tilde{\mathbf{F}}^f = \operatorname{clamp}\big( \operatorname{BN}(
\mathbf{F}^f ), -\tau, \tau \big),
$$

with $\tau = 10$. This bounds the feature magnitude to a range compatible with
the pretrained detection head while preserving the relative ordering of the
gated fusion. We also initialize the gating network's final bias to $-2.0$,
which yields $\sigma(-2.0) \approx 0.12$, biasing the gate toward the original
features early in training and preventing the detection loss from spiking on
unstable restored features.

## Depth-Guided FSG (DG-FSG)

For the depth-aware variant, we augment the gating network with a monocular
depth estimate. A lightweight depth decoder $\mathcal{D}$ progressively
upsamples a bottleneck feature to produce a dense depth map
$\hat{d} \in \mathbb{R}^{H \times W}$. The depth encoding is resized to each
scale and concatenated with the restoration and original features:

$$
\boldsymbol{\alpha} = \sigma\Big( g_\phi\big( [\mathbf{F}^r; \, \mathbf{F}^o;
\, \mathcal{E}(\hat{d})] \big) \Big),
$$

where $\mathcal{E}$ is a depth encoder. This formulation exploits the physical
prior that fog severity increases with depth: distant regions (large $d$)
benefit more from dehazing, so the gate can learn a depth-conditional fusion
policy. The depth decoder is supervised with a scale-invariant loss [24] on
synthetic data.

## Multi-Density Fog Training

A central limitation of prior foggy-driving benchmarks is that they train on a
single fog density $\beta$, causing the detector to memorize a specific
atmospheric appearance. We instead exploit the fact that the Foggy Cityscapes
dataset [12] provides the same scene rendered at multiple
scattering coefficients $\beta \in \{0.005, 0.01, 0.02\}$. Training on all
three densities simultaneously:

1. **Triples the effective training data**, mitigating overfitting on the
   limited set of annotated scenes;
2. **Enforces fog-severity invariance**, compelling the network to learn
   representations that are robust across the atmospheric continuum rather
   than a single operating point.

Formally, the training set is
$\mathcal{D} = \bigcup_{\beta \in \mathcal{B}} \mathcal{D}_\beta$, where
$\mathcal{B} = \{0.005, 0.01, 0.02\}$ and $\mathcal{D}_\beta$ is the set of
images rendered at density $\beta$. This multi-density strategy is a
principled, physically grounded form of data expansion that directly targets
the task's core challenge.

## Datasets

WRDNet is trained and evaluated on a combination of synthetic and real-world
adverse-weather datasets. Table I summarizes the datasets, their roles, and
their citations.

**Table I: Datasets used in WRDNet.**

| Dataset | Type | Split | Role | Citation |
|---------|------|-------|------|----------|
| Foggy Cityscapes | Synthetic fog (labeled) | train + val | Supervised detection + restoration + depth | [12] |
| ACDC | Real fog (unlabeled) | train | Domain adaptation (FDA, DCT, FSG-consistency) | [26] |
| ACDC | Real fog (labeled) | val | Validation (mAP monitoring) | [26] |
| Foggy Driving | Real fog (labeled) | test | Final evaluation (test mAP) | [12] |
| Foggy Zurich | Real fog (unlabeled) | test | Cross-domain generalization | [27] |

**Synthetic training data.** The primary supervised training signal comes from
the Foggy Cityscapes dataset [12], which renders each Cityscapes scene at three
scattering coefficients $\beta \in \{0.005, 0.01, 0.02\}$. We use both the
`train` and `val` splits for training (3,475 base scenes × 3 densities = 10,425
images), since our final evaluation is on the disjoint ACDC and Foggy Driving
datasets. Each synthetic sample provides a foggy image, its clear ground truth,
a disparity-derived depth map, and instance-level bounding-box labels for eight
driving-relevant classes.

**Real-world domain-adaptation data.** To bridge the synthetic-to-real gap, we
use the ACDC dataset [26] as the unlabeled target domain during Phase 2. The
ACDC `train` split provides real foggy images without labels, which drive the
three domain-adaptation losses (FDA, DCT alignment, and FSG consistency). The
ACDC `val` split, which has labels, is used to monitor mAP during training.

**Real-world evaluation data.** For the final evaluation, we use the Foggy
Driving dataset [12], a standard benchmark of real foggy driving scenes with
bounding-box annotations, and the Foggy Zurich dataset [27] to assess
cross-domain generalization to an unseen real-world fog distribution.

## Domain Adaptation

To bridge the gap between synthetic fog and real-world fog, we incorporate
unsupervised domain adaptation using real foggy images from the ACDC dataset
[26]. The synthetic branch provides supervised detection
supervision, while the real branch provides an unlabeled domain signal through
three complementary losses:

1. **Frequency Domain Adaptation (FDA)** [21] — swaps the
   low-frequency components of synthetic and real images to align their
   spectral statistics.
2. **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) alignment** — aligns the feature
   distributions of the two domains in the frequency domain via a
   maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) loss.
3. **FSG consistency** — encourages the gating maps produced on synthetic and
   real images to be consistent given their estimated fog density, promoting
   domain-invariant fusion.

The total training objective is a weighted sum of the detection loss
$\mathcal{L}_{\text{det}}$, restoration loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{rest}}$,
depth loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{depth}}$, and domain losses:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{det}} + \lambda_r \mathcal{L}_{\text{rest}} +
\lambda_d \mathcal{L}_{\text{depth}} + \lambda_{\text{dom}}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{dom}} + \lambda_{\text{fsg}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{fsg}},
$$

where the domain weight $\lambda_{\text{dom}}$ is linearly ramped from $0$ to
its target value over the first epochs to avoid destabilizing the detector
early in training.

## Two-Phase Training

### Rationale for Two-Phase Training

WRDNet is trained in two sequential phases, each with a distinct objective and
data configuration. This staged strategy is motivated by three considerations.

First, the detection head is initialized from a randomly initialized 8-class
Cityscapes head (replacing the pretrained 80-class COCO head), which must learn
the driving-relevant class semantics from scratch. Training this head jointly
with the restoration branch and the domain-adaptation modules from the outset
would expose it to conflicting gradients from multiple objectives, destabilizing
the box regression. A dedicated warmup phase isolates the detection objective,
allowing the head to converge to a robust baseline before auxiliary tasks are
introduced.

Second, the Feature Selection Gate (FSG) fuses restoration and detection
features whose magnitudes differ substantially. When the restoration branch is
frozen and the detection head is not yet calibrated, the fused features can
exhibit unbounded magnitude that saturates the Distribution Focal Loss (DFL)
[23] in the detection head, causing the predicted box edges to collapse to a
degenerate configuration. Deferring the FSG to a later phase, after the
detection baseline is established, mitigates this instability.

Third, unsupervised domain adaptation requires a well-initialized detector to
provide a meaningful pseudo-supervision signal. Applying the domain-adaptation
losses to an undertrained detector would align features that are not yet
discriminative, yielding a poor adaptation. The two-phase schedule ensures that
the detector is sufficiently trained before the domain-alignment objectives are
activated.

### Phase 1: Detection Warmup

In the first phase, WRDNet is trained exclusively on the multi-density synthetic
data from Foggy Cityscapes [12]. The restoration branch (DehazeFormer-T [15])
is **frozen**, and the Feature Selection Gate is **bypassed**, so the detection
branch operates directly on the original foggy image features. This isolates
the detection objective and establishes a robust baseline.

**Objective.** The training objective in Phase 1 is the detection loss only:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Phase 1}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{det}},
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{det}}$ is the YOLO detection loss comprising box
regression, classification, and Distribution Focal Loss components [23].

**What the model learns.** During Phase 1, the detection branch learns to
localize and classify the eight driving-relevant classes (person, rider, car,
truck, bus, train, motorcycle, bicycle) across the three fog densities
$\beta \in \{0.005, 0.01, 0.02\}$. Because the training data spans multiple
scattering coefficients, the detector learns fog-severity-invariant
representations rather than memorizing a single atmospheric appearance. The
multi-density data, combined with RandomScale and ColorJitter augmentation,
mitigates overfitting on the limited annotated scenes.

**Configuration.** Table II summarizes the Phase 1 configuration.

**Table II: Phase 1 (Detection Warmup) configuration.**

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Training data | Foggy Cityscapes (train + val, 3 densities) |
| Restoration branch | Frozen |
| Feature Selection Gate | Bypassed |
| Depth decoder | Disabled |
| Domain adaptation | Disabled |
| Epochs | 50 |
| Batch size | 24 |
| Learning rate | $1 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| Optimizer | AdamW |
| Scheduler | Cosine annealing |
| Early stopping | Patience 10 on ACDC val mAP |

### Phase 2: Joint Fine-Tuning with Domain Adaptation

In the second phase, all components of WRDNet are **unfrozen**, the Feature
Selection Gate is **enabled** (with the magnitude clamp), and unsupervised
domain adaptation is applied using real foggy images from the ACDC dataset [26].
The synthetic branch provides supervised detection supervision, while the real
branch provides an unlabeled domain signal.

**Objective.** The Phase 2 objective combines the detection, restoration, depth,
and domain-adaptation losses:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Phase 2}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{det}} + \lambda_r
\mathcal{L}_{\text{rest}} + \lambda_d \mathcal{L}_{\text{depth}} +
\lambda_{\text{dom}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{dom}} + \lambda_{\text{fsg}}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{fsg}},
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{rest}}$ is the restoration loss, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{depth}}$
is the depth loss, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{dom}}$ is the domain-alignment loss, and
$\mathcal{L}_{\text{fsg}}$ is the FSG-consistency loss. The domain weight
$\lambda_{\text{dom}}$ is linearly ramped from $0$ to its target value over the
first epochs to avoid destabilizing the detector.

**What the model learns.** During Phase 2, the model learns to:

1. **Fuse restoration and detection features** through the FSG, which learns a
   per-pixel weighting between dehazed and original features. The gate learns
   to favor dehazed features in distant, fog-obscured regions and original
   features in near-field regions.
2. **Align synthetic and real domains** through the three domain-adaptation
   losses (FDA, DCT alignment, FSG consistency), enabling the learned
   representations to transfer to real-world fog.
3. **Estimate monocular depth** through the depth decoder, which provides a
   depth-conditional signal to the DG-FSG variant.

**Configuration.** Table III summarizes the Phase 2 configuration.

**Table III: Phase 2 (Joint Fine-Tuning with Domain Adaptation) configuration.**

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Training data | Foggy Cityscapes (synthetic) + ACDC (real) |
| Restoration branch | Unfrozen |
| Feature Selection Gate | Enabled (magnitude clamp $\tau = 10$) |
| Depth decoder | Enabled |
| Domain adaptation | FDA + DCT alignment + FSG consistency |
| Epochs | 120 |
| Batch size | 6 (paired synth + real) |
| Learning rate | $2 \times 10^{-4}$ |
| Optimizer | AdamW |
| Scheduler | Cosine annealing |
| Early stopping | Patience 10 on ACDC val mAP |

### Optimization Details

Both phases use the AdamW optimizer with a cosine learning-rate schedule and
gradient clipping at unit norm. Mixed-precision training is performed in
bfloat16, which provides the exponent range of float32 (preventing overflow in
the gating convolutions) while retaining the throughput benefits of reduced
precision on modern tensor-core hardware. The learning rate in Phase 2 is set
lower than in Phase 1 to avoid destabilizing the pretrained detection head when
the domain-adaptation losses are introduced.
